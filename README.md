# GAN
Generative Adversarial Networks.

GAN based Neural Networks

## DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
GAN using CNN archetectures.

In the Notebook, I used the Pokemon dataset and created Pokemon, and Pikachu.

## PGGAN (Progressive GAN)
progressing the size of the image from low to high. Using the same weight throughout the learning stages.

In the Notebook, I used the Pokemon dataset and created Pokemon.
